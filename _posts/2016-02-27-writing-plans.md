但是，我还是下定决心希望2016年能写出几篇还像样的文章，题材已经定好了，就叫“R和工作”。

# 为什么是个题目？

## 什么是R

- 流行的开源统计语言
- 专长 data mungling 、data visualization 、reproducible reporting
- IDE: Rstudio + VC: git & Github + RMarkdown
- packages: 
    - Hadleyverse: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, stringr, etc.
    - data.table: The killer
    - shiny

## R能在工作中帮助我们什么？

### Simple

- deal with data mungling problems that's difficult in excel 
- simple reproducible reporting -> you actually want your results to be reproducible.
- it's similiar with python, like handling automatical tasks -> send multiple email, download data from the web, etc.

### Sophiscated

- replace the tedious, error-prone, hard-to-maintain excel models
- build your own shiny apps and share
- build your own packages to tackle certain headache issues in your work
- some smart plays

# The plan

- how to build an R working environment quickly?
    - build it hand by hand on PC / Mac
    - use docker
    - how to handle the database connection problems
    - things that might be concerned in China T_T
- the things that R can greatly help
    - Excel is good, but we could be better
    - ...
- best practices that I want to share
    - exposure yourself to the cutting-edge tech (R-blogs, Github, etc.)
    - use Hadley's packages and his books
    - Rstudio and Rstudio CO.
    - Learning is an endless road
- Show your colleagues some shiny
- Why not python? Why not Matlab? Why not C++? Why not ...
- A shiny app with a tangible model behind (use the idea of Class in R)
- .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .pdf, .html -> Oh, all can be reproducible.
