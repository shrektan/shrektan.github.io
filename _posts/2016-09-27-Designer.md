What we do mostly is to __connect the dots__.

What does this mean?

It means to find the most suitable technologies or tools to get the things done, under certain circumstances.

It means we find the best solution in constrains.

Yes, it's important to have one to push the technology. However, I don't think these two jobs are isolated. They are not independent. Instead, one pushes the other.

How could we do better?

Read a lot, watch by heart.
