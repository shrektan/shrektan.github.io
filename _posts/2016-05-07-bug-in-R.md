title: Find a bug in R
---

One of the most headache problems in R (maybe in all programming) is the `Encoding` issues in the windows platform. Even the veterans in the R-Core team can't survive.

In the new version of R 3.3.0, there's an upgrade related to `match(x, table)` (see [#PR16491](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16491)). However, it leads to unconsistent behaviors when `x` and `table` contains non ascii characters. So, I filed my first [issue](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16885) in the [bugs.r-project.org](https://bugs.r-project.org/) and it seems that the issue has been confirmed as a bug.


What a wonderful world it will be, if all the characters are encoded in `UTF-8` :D.
